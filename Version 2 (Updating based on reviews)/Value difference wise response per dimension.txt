Source and target country dimension value wise suggestions





Power Distance Index (low versus high)
a) < 50 meaning 
	dimensionName = low power distance
b) > 50 meaning
	dimensionName = high power distance

1. source > target value on the same side (<50):
Although [source] and [target] follows [dimensionName] values but [source] should diel it up a bit to cater for the [target] culture.

2. source < target value on the same side (<50):
Although [source] and [target] follows [dimensionName] values but [source] should diel it down a bit to cater for the [target] culture.

3. source > target value on the same side (>50):
Although [source] and [target] follows [dimensionName] values but [source] should diel it down a bit to cater for the [target] culture.

4. source < target value on the same side (>50):
Although [source] and [target] follows [dimensionName] values but [source] should diel it up a bit to cater for the [target] culture.

5. source and target value on different sides:
if target > 50:
	dimensionName = high power distance

	dimensionName = low power distance
[source] and [target] follows different values. So, [source] should learn the ways of [dimensionName] culture.
